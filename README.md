# Evaluation and Optimization of Neurological Data Sets in Quantum Feature Maps and Comparison with Conventional Classical Methods

This repository contains code and resources for evaluating and optimizing neurological datasets using quantum feature maps. It also includes a comparative analysis with conventional classical methods to highlight the potential advantages and limitations of quantum approaches.

## Project Structure

- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with the implementation of quantum and classical methods for data processing and analysis.
- **`data/`**: Includes the neurological dataset (`*.csv`) used in this project.
- **`results/`**: Stores output files, plots, and performance metrics from the experiments.

## Requirements

To run the code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries: 
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `qiskit`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `seaborn`
  - `jupyter`

You can install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in the `data/` folder as a `.csv` file. It contains neurological data preprocessed for feature extraction and classification tasks. Detailed information about the dataset can be found in the associated research documentation.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuantumNeurologicalData.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd QuantumNeurologicalData
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Explore and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.

## Key Features

- Implementation of quantum feature maps using Qiskit.
